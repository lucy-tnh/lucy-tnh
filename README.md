**`Software Engineering Student at University of canterbury`**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Canterbury, passionate about turning ideas into code and solving real-world problems with tech.

ðŸ’» Currently learning and building my skills in software development, and looking for a software engineering internship for the 2025/26 summer to gain hands-on experience and grow as a developer.

ðŸŒ± Outside of coding, Iâ€™ve worked as a uni mentor supporting first-year engineering students, and as front-of-house at a busy cafÃ©â€”both roles have sharpened my communication and teamwork skills.
